# UFOs

# Overview Of Project

In this project we created a dynamic HTML webpage which renders a table holding UFO sighting data categorized by 
date, city, state, country, shape, duration, and a section for comments/descritions. The page utilizes bootstrap and css to add aethstic modifications and images to the page. The HTML document also utilizes the object oriented programing language JavaScript to take inputs from the page and modify/build the HTML table based on the values recieved from these user inputs. For this Challenge we will be adding filters for each category so that the user can filter the data from the data.js to render the HTML table according the the values for each category.


# Results
- There is a description of how to perform a search, with images.

## Filterting the Table
We have five different input boxes to filter the adjacent table to only contain data with categories holding the values placed in the input boxes
